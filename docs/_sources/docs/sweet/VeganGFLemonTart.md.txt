## Steps

1.  Add all filling ingredients to a medium-size saucepan and whisk to disperse the corn flour.
2.  Bring to medium to high heat for 5-10 minutes while whisking constantly. The mixture should thicken quickly and coat the back of a spatula. If there are any lumps in the mixture, blend using a stick blender.
3. Quickly pour the mixture into your baked tart shell and smooth the top if necessary. Allow the tart to set in the fridge for at least 3 hours.
