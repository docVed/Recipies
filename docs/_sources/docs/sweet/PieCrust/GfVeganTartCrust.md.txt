## Steps

1. preheat oven to **180 C**.
2. Mix Softened/melted **margarine, flour, sugar, almond meal** using a flat beater in a kitchen mixer until it is evenly mixed.
3. Slowly add **water** until smooth dough is formed, but do not over-work the dough.
4. Can be stored in the fridge for an hour to stiffen dough, making it put into the tin.
5. Press the dough into the tart tin, ensuring an even coverage, using a flat spatula can make this easier.  Trim edges.
6. Cook for 10-12 minutes at **180 C** or until light golden.

## Cooking Notes

* Ceramic baking dishes have more thermal inertia, so blind baking using the bottom heating element only cooks the dough more evenly.
