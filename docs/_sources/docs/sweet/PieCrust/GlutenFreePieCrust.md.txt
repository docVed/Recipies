## Ingredients

Ingredients in the order they are required.
| Quantity     | Ingredient                  |
|:-------------|:----------------------------|
| 210 grams    | all-purpose gf flour        |
| 3/4 tsp      | xantham gum*                |
| 1/4 tsp      | baking poweder              |
| 1/2 tsp      | table salt                  |
|              |                             |
| 84 grams     | cold, unsalted butter       |
| 120 grams    | cold, sour cream (full fat) |
|              |                             |
| as necessary | very cold water             |
|              |                             |
|              | gf flour (for dusting)      |

\* Only add xantham gum if flour doesn't already contain it.

1.  Place flour, xantham gum, baking powder and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
2.  Cut butter into small 1 cm cubes and add them to flour mixture.
3.  Toss them around so that they’re coated and use your fingers to squash each butter cube into flat pieces.
```{note}
You could also use a pastry blender, stand mixer, or a food processor, but go very easy on it, especially the food processor — you want flat-ish, 1 dollar coin sized pieces of butter, not the usual “coarse meal” or “small pea-sized” mixture. If using a food processor, when you’re done, dump this butter-flour mixture into a large bowl before continuing.
```

4.  Add a teaspoon at a time of the cold water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together. If dough is still dry, keep adding small amounts of water Until the dough just sticks together.

5.  Chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.
6.   Preheat oven to **190 C**.
7.  Unwrap dough, place on a well-floured counter, sprinkle the top generously with flour, and roll it out into a thick-ish long rectangle.
8.  Brush off excess flour off dough with your hands and fold it as you would a business letter, into thirds.
9.  Roll this packet into the shape needed for your final pie but a 35 cm round is the usual size for a standard pie crust. And place it in a pie or tart tin.

11. Trim dough so that its overhang beyond the pie plate lip is only 2.5cm. Tuck rim of dough underneath itself and crimp it decoratively (with fork or by pinching).
10. Line the base and sides of the uncooked pastry case with non-stick baking paper. Fill with rice, dried beans, or metal or ceramic baking weights. (This stops the pastry base rising during cooking.) Place on a baking tray and cook in the oven for 8-10 minutes.
13. Transfer pie to wire rack to cool. It's now ready to add your pie/tart filling
