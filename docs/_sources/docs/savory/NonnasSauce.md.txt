## Notes

1. De-stringing celery is quite a pain, so instead it is also possible to chop the celery into finer 1-2.5 mm slices instead.
2. Home-made raw passata may contain more liquid than store-bought, so may need to double number of bottles added and not add any water.


## Method

1. Tie herbs (**rosemary,bay leaves,basil,parsley**) into a "bouquet garni" with white cotton string. Put bay leaves on the outside and wrap the string multiple times up and down the length of the bunch using a knot at both ends.
2. Add oil to saucepan and fry **onion** and **garlic** on medium heat until softened.
3. Add grated **carrot** and chopped **celery**. Stir well and cook until celery is softened.
4. Add bottles of **sauce**, **salt**, and bouquet garni. Stir and bring to boil, add water to ensure sauce doesn't thicken too early (mainly required with store-bought passata).
5. Reduce heat to simmer and stir every 20-30 mins for 1.5-2 hours. Sauce is done when red oil is visible on the surface of the sauce.
