## Method

### Wings

1. Break down the cauliflower into florets of approximately the same size.
2. Combine the flour, water, salt, paprika powder, garlic powder, and ground pepper into a thick batter.
3. Heat the frying oil in a pot (if you use a smaller pot you can use less oil but you have to work in more batches, and make sure not to fill the pot with too much oil to prevent it from boiling over) or deep fryer to 350°F/175°C.
4. Once the oil is hot, dip one cauliflower floret after another into the batter. Let them fry for 4 to 5 minutes until florets are golden and crispy. Set them aside on paper towels to let excess oil drip off. Repeat until all the cauliflower wings are fried.

### BBQ Sauce

1. Thin out the BBQ sauce by adding the water until you can easily drizzle it.
2. Put all the cauliflower wings in a large bowl, add the BBQ sauce, and toss until all wings are coated. 
   

### Vegan Mayo

1. Add all ingredients except oil to a container
2. Mix with an immersion blender for 1 minute then slowly canola oil while the immersion blender is running. 
3. Blend for 3 minutes until the mayo is thick and creamy. 
4. Add more salt, mustard, or lime juice to taste. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days. Add a splash of water to make the mayo easier to drizzle.
