recipe

## Equipment

* Mixing bowl
* Scales
* pastry blender (or fork)
* 30cm Ceramic pie dish
* Baking paper
* Rolling pin
* Dry rice, beans or ceramic baking beads

A silicone or plastic baking/dough mat is quite handy when rolling out the dough. When a food safe flat surface is not available

```
2 1/2 cups (325 grams) flour
1 tablespoon (15 grams) granulated sugar
1 teaspoon (5 grams) fine sea or table salt
1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) unsalted butter, very cold

## Ingredients

| quantity             | Ingredient            |
| :------------------- | :-------------------- |
| 325 grams            | all-purpose flour     |
| 15 grams             | granulated sugar      |
| 1 teaspoon (5 grams) | table salt            |
|                      |                       |
| 225 grams            | cold, unsalted butter |
|                      |                       |
| 120 + 60 grams       | very cold water       |

1. Place flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. 
2. Cut butter into small 1 cm cubes and add them to flour mixture. 
3. Toss them around so that they’re coated and used your the pastry blender
```{note}
You could also use a stand mixer, or a food processor, but go very easy on it, especially the food processor — you want small pea sized pieces of butter. If using a food processor, when you’re done, dump this butter-flour mixture into a large bowl before continuing.
```

4. Pour 120 g of the cold water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together. If dough is still dry, keep adding small amounts of water (up to 60 g), until the dough just clumps together and bring it together with your hands. Divide dough into two parts, and wrap each half into flat-ish packets wrapped in plastic, waxed or parchment paper.
5. Chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.
6. Roll the two packets into the shape needed for your final pie but a 35 cm round is the usual size for a standard pie crust.
