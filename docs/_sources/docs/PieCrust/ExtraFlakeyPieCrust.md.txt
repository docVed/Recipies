## Ingredients

| quantity       | Ingredient            |
| :------------- | :-------------------- |
| 260 grams      | all-purpose flour     |
| 15 grams       | granulated sugar      |
| 3/4 teaspoon   | table salt            |
|                |                       |
| 230 grams      | cold, unsalted butter |
|                |                       |
| 120 + 40 grams | very cold water       |

1. Place flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine. 
2. Cut butter into small 1 cm cubes and add them to flour mixture. 
3. Toss them around so that they’re coated and used your fingers to squash each butter cube into flat pieces.
```{note}
You could also use a pastry blender, stand mixer, or a food processor, but go very easy on it, especially the food processor — you want flat-ish, 1 dollar coin sized pieces of butter, not the usual “coarse meal” or “small pea-sized” mixture. If using a food processor, when you’re done, dump this butter-flour mixture into a large bowl before continuing.

4. Pour 120 g of the cold water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together. If dough is still dry, keep adding small amounts of water (up to 40 g). It will seem too wet and sticky, but will be just fine. Divide dough into two parts, and wrap each half into flat-ish packets wrapped in plastic, waxed or parchment paper.

5. Chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.

6. Unwrap first packet of dough, place on a well-floured counter, sprinkle the top generously with flour, and roll it out into a thick-ish long rectangle. 
7. Brush off excess flour off dough with your hands and fold it as you would a business letter, into thirds. 
8. Roll this packet into the shape needed for your final pie but a 35 cm round is the usual size for a standard pie crust.
