### Ingredients

| Ingredient  | 4 tarts| 2 tarts| 1 tart | unit  |
| :---------- | ---: | --: | ----: | :---------- |
| Flour       | 1250 | 625 | 312   | g           |
| Soft Butter | 450  | 225 | 112   | g           |
| Salt        | 1/2  | 1/4 | 1/8   | tsp         |
| Icing Sugar | 450  | 225 | 112   | g           |
|             |
| Whole Eggs  | 7    | 4   | 2     | medium eggs |

### Steps

1. preheat oven to **220 C**.
2. Mix Softened **butter, flour, sugar** and **salt** using a flat beater in a kitchen mixer until it starts to break up.
3. Slowly add **eggs** until smooth dough is formed, but do not over work the dough.
4. If making multiple tarts, split into multiple 600g balls.
5. Can be stored in the fridge for a few hours to stiffen dough, making it easier to roll out without sticking.
6. Roll out dough to TBD cm diameter. if dough is room temperature, roll between two sheets of baking paper to avoid it sticking.
7. Put pastry in non stick or pre buttered tart tin and trim edges.
8. Line the base and sides of an uncooked pastry case with non-stick baking paper. Fill with rice, dried beans, or metal or ceramic baking weights. (This stops the pastry base rising during cooking.) Place on a baking tray and cook in an oven preheated to **220 C** for 8-10 minutes.
9. Remove the pastry case from the oven and remove baking paper and weights . Cook for a further 5-10 minutes or until light golden.

### Cooking Notes

* Ceramic baking dishes have more thermal inertia, so blind baking using the bottom heating element only cooks the dough more evenly.
* If pastry edges begin to brown prematurely, covering them with foil will prevent further browning.

## Lemon Curd Filling

### Equipment

* Heat resistant mixing bowl
* Whisk
* Pot as a Double Boiler
* Thermometer (useful, but optional)
* Sieve (ideally flat bottomed for ease of use)
