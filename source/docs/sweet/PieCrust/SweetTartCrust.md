## Ingredients

| Ingredient         | 4 tarts | 2 tarts | 1 tart | unit        |
| :----------------- | ------: | ------: | -----: | :---------- |
| Flour              |    1250 |     625 |    312 | g           |
| Soft/melted Butter |     450 |     225 |    112 | g           |
| Salt               |     1/2 |     1/4 |    1/8 | tsp         |
| Icing Sugar        |     450 |     225 |    112 | g           |
|                    |         |         |        |             |
| Whole Eggs         |       7 |       4 |      2 | medium eggs |

## Steps

1. preheat oven to **220 C**.
2. Mix Softened/melted **butter, flour, sugar** and **salt** using a flat beater in a kitchen mixer until it starts to break up.
3. Slowly add **eggs** until smooth dough is formed, but do not over-work the dough.
4. If making multiple tarts, split into multiple 600g balls.
5. Can be stored in the fridge for a few hours to stiffen dough, making it easier to roll out without sticking.
6. Roll out dough to ~36 cm diameter. if dough is at room temperature, roll between two sheets of baking paper to avoid it sticking.
7. Put pastry in non stick or pre-buttered tart tin and trim edges.
8. Line the base and sides of an uncooked pastry case with non-stick baking paper. Fill with rice, dried beans, or metal or ceramic baking weights. (This stops the pastry base rising during cooking.) Place on a baking tray and cook in an oven preheated to **220 C** for 8-10 minutes.
9. Remove the pastry case from the oven and remove baking paper and weights. Cook for a further 5-10 minutes or until light golden.

## Cooking Notes

* Ceramic baking dishes have more thermal inertia, so blind baking using the bottom heating element only cooks the dough more evenly.
* If pastry edges begin to brown prematurely, covering them with foil will prevent further browning.
