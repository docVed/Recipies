Very light modification of [Smitten Kitchen's](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/03/extra-flaky-pie-crust/)
recipe. Use this crust with the [Strawberry and Rhubarb Pie Filling](../StrawberryRhubarbPie.md).

## Equipment

* Mixing bowl
* Scales
* Kitchen mixer (or elbow grease)
* 30cm Ceramic pie dish
* Baking paper
* Rolling pin

```{note}
A silicone or plastic baking/dough mat is quite handy for rolling out the dough when a food safe flat surface is not available

## Ingredients

| Quantity       | Ingredient            |
| :------------- | :-------------------- |
| 260 grams      | all-purpose flour     |
| 15 grams       | granulated sugar      |
| 3/4 tsp (5g)   | table salt            |
|                |                       |
| 230 grams      | cold, unsalted butter |
|                |                       |
| 120 + 40 grams | very cold water       |

1. Place flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
2. Cut butter into small 1 cm cubes and add them to flour mixture.
3. Toss them around so that they’re coated and used your fingers to squash each butter cube into flat pieces.
```{note}
You could also use a pastry blender, stand mixer, or a food processor, but go very easy on it, especially the food processor — you want flat-ish, 1 dollar coin sized pieces of butter, not the usual “coarse meal” or “small pea-sized” mixture. If using a food processor, when you’re done, dump this butter-flour mixture into a large bowl before continuing.

4. Pour 120 g of the cold water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together. If dough is still dry, keep adding small amounts of water (up to 40 g). It will seem too wet and sticky, but will be just fine. Divide dough into two parts, and wrap each half into flat-ish packets wrapped in plastic, waxed or parchment paper.

5. Chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.

6. Unwrap first packet of dough, place on a well-floured counter, sprinkle the top generously with flour, and roll it out into a thick-ish long rectangle.
7. Brush off excess flour off dough with your hands and fold it as you would a business letter, into thirds.
8. Roll this packet into the shape needed for your final pie but a 35 cm round is the usual size for a standard pie crust.

9. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Mound filling inside bottom pie crust.
10. Unwrap Second packet of dough, place on a well-floured counter, roll it out and fold into thirds, just like the first ball of dough.
11. Roll dough into an 11-inch (28cm) circle and cut decorative slits in it. Transfer it to center over the pie filling.

12. Trim top and bottom pie dough so that their overhang beyond the pie plate lip is only 1/2-inch. Tuck rim of dough underneath itself and crimp it decoratively.
13. Transfer pie to a baking sheet (This pie may leak a bit of butter from over the edge) and brush egg yolk mixture over dough. Bake for 20 minutes then reduce temperature to 170 degrees and bake for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, until the pie is golden and the juices bubble visibly.
14. Transfer pie to wire rack to cool. When full cool (several hours later) the juices gel.
