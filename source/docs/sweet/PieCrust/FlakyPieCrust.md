## Ingredients

| Quantity        | Ingredient            |
|:----------------|:----------------------|
| 325 grams       | all-purpose flour     |
| 15 grams        | granulated sugar      |
| 1 tsp (5 grams) | table salt            |
|                 |                       |
| 225 grams       | cold, unsalted butter |
|                 |                       |
| 120 + 60 grams  | very cold water       |

01. Place flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
02. Cut butter into small 1 cm cubes and add them to flour mixture.
03. Toss them around so that they’re coated and used your the pastry blender
```{note}
You could also use a stand mixer, or a food processor, but go very easy on it, especially the food processor — you want small pea sized pieces of butter. If using a food processor, when you’re done, dump this butter-flour mixture into a large bowl before continuing.

04. Pour 120 g of the cold water over butter-flour mixture and use a flexible silicone spatula or scraper to bring it together. If dough is still dry, keep adding small amounts of water (up to 60 g), until the dough just clumps together and bring it together with your hands. Divide dough into two parts, and wrap each half into flat-ish packets wrapped in plastic, waxed or parchment paper.
05. Chill in the fridge until firm — one to two hours.
06. Roll the first dough packet into a 31 cm round and transfer it into the pie dish.
07. Add pie filling of your choice.
08. Roll the second dough packet into an 11-inch (28cm) circle and cut decorative slits in it. Transfer it to center over the pie filling.

09.  Trim top and bottom pie dough so that their overhang beyond the pie plate lip is only 1/2-inch. Tuck rim of dough underneath itself and crimp it decoratively.
10. Transfer pie to a baking sheet (This pie may leak a bit of butter from over the edge) and brush egg yolk mixture over dough. Bake for 20 minutes then reduce temperature to 170 degrees and bake for an additional 25 to 30 minutes, until the pie is golden and the juices bubble visibly.
11. Transfer pie to wire rack to cool. When full cool (several hours later) the juices gel.
