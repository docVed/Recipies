4. Whisk **sugar** and **eggs** in a large bowl.
5. Add strawberry and rhubarb juice and **cream**, then whisk.
6. Just before adding filling to base, heat over a double boiler while continually stirring. Take it off once it reaches **50 C**  or until the curd starts thickening on the bottom of the bowl.
7. Pour heated filing through a sieve into the blind-baked tart base.
8. Cook for approximately 30 minutes in preheated oven. Check curd has been set by wobbling it, it should have a stiff jelly consistency.
   
## Alternate Preserving method

To set the curd by itself so it keeps longer. Pour unheated curd into jars, add to a deep pot and submerge with water, raise to boiling for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat and let cool down in the water for around 20 minutes before removing.
