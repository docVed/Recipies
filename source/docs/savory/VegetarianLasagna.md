|          | water (see note 1.)            |
|          |                                |

|   1.2 kg | eggplant (3 medium size)       |
|          |                                |
|        8 | large eggs                     |
|          |                                |
|     750g | lasagna sheets (ready to cook) |
|     800g | Dry Mozzarella                 |
|     150g | Parmesan                       |


## Notes

1. The sauce may need to be diluted with water depending on what type of lasagna
   sheet is used and how thick it is already. Fresh sheets need less water in
   the sauce, while dry sheets require quite a thin sauce.  For dried sheets,
   the sauce must be around the viscosity of fruit nectar. A good way to test is
   to gently pick up the sauce with a fork. The sauce should mostly fall through
   the tines, but not be as thin as water.
2. The various components (sauce, grilled vegetables, eggs) can be made a few
   days ahead of time and refrigerated. 
3. The lasagna itself can be assembled and partially cooked (no browning stage)
   the day before then reheated and browned just before eating.
4. If desired, the zucchini can be grated and incorporated into the
   sauce itself instead of grilling it, but the lasagna would need another
   ingredient like ricotta or roast capsicum/pumpkin added as a third filling
   layer. 

## Method

**Grilled Vegetables*
1. Preheat oven to 210°C.
2. Cut eggplant into 10 mm thick slices and arrange on a lined baking tray.
3. Cut zucchini into 5 mm thick slices and arrange on a lined baking tray.
4. Generously spray/drizzle both sides of the vegetables with olive oil and bake
   in the oven for around **20-35 minutes** or until lightly browned and
   softened, then flip veggies and repeat for **10-15 minutes**, or until
   lightly browned. If the veggies haven't been browned in that time, turn on
   the top grill to finish them off.

**Hard-Boiled Eggs**
1. Boil a pot of water, submerge eggs for **7-8 minutes**, then quickly cool
  them down in either a bath of ice water or continually running water. 
1. Wait **5 minutes** for eggs to completely cool, then peel and cut into 5mm
   slices.

2. Put down a generous even layer of sauce in the roasting pan.
3. Place a layer of pasta sheets (snap them if required) across the entire pan.
4. Cover sheets in sauce, layer eggplant, then grate 1/4 of both Mozzarella and
   parmesan cheese on top. 
5. Repeat pasta/sauce/filling/cheese layering two more times with the egg and
   zucchini fillings.
6. For the final layer, there is no filling, just add pasta, sauce and cheese.
7. Fully cover the pan with baking paper, then aluminium foil and place in the
   oven for **50 minutes**.
8. Uncover the lasagna, then bake for a further **20 minutes** to crisp
   the top.
