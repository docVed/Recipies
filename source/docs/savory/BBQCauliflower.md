# BBQ Cauliflower wings

Taken wholesale from the Cravings Made Vegan cook book

## Equipment


## Ingredients For wings

½ head (400 g) cauliflower
1¼ cups (150 g) flour
1 cup (240 ml) water
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon paprika powder
1⁄8 teaspoon garlic powder
ground pepper
oil for frying


INGREDIENTS FOR
BBQ SAUCE
3 tablespoons vegan BBQ
sauce
2 tablespoons water


INSTRUCTIONS FOR CAULIFLOWER WINGS
1. Break down the cauliflower into florets of approximately
the same size.
2. Combine the flour, water, salt, paprika powder, garlic
powder, and ground pepper into a thick batter.
3. Heat the frying oil in a pot (if you use a smaller pot
you can use less oil but you have to work in more
batches, and make sure not to fill the pot with too
much oil to prevent it from boiling over) or deep fryer to
350°F/175°C.
4. Once the oil is hot, dip one cauliflower floret after
another into the batter. Let them fry for 4 to 5 minutes
until florets are golden and crispy. Set them aside on
paper towels to let excess oil drip off. Repeat until all
the cauliflower wings are fried.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR BBQ SAUCE
1. Thin out the BBQ sauce by adding the water until you
can easily drizzle it.
2. Put all the cauliflower wings in a large bowl, add the
BBQ sauce, and toss until all wings are coated. They
are the best when served fresh! A ranch dip or vegan
mayo* are the ideal dipping sauces

*To make a quick vegan mayo, to a bowl add 1⁄8 cup (30 ml) unsweetened soy milk, ¼ teaspoon apple cider vine-
gar, 1⁄8 teaspoon mustard, 1⁄8 teaspoon maple syrup, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon lime juice. With an immersion
blender mix for 1 minute then slowly drizzle 1⁄3 cup (80 g) canola oil while the immersion blender is running. Blend 3
minutes until the mayo is thick and creamy. Add more salt, mustard, or lime juice to taste. Store in the fridge for up
to 3 days. Add a splash of water to make the mayo easier to drizzle.
